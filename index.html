        <h3>Reflection post</h3>
        <p>If I reflect on period 1 I was expeting more of me. I was kinda sad that I was not able to pass php exam.
            Personally, I need to start investing more time into Css as it where I lack the most. This now leeds to me have to pass 2 exams insted of only 1 in period 2
            Something I know I can do.</p>
        <p> Overall I am really happy with my choice of coming to NHL Stenden. I enjoy the teachers I enjoy the university. As mention before
            this for me is just a prepartion for my master in Networking. I have a lot of prior knwolege in what we are learing, this helps me take things easier
            I was looking forward for the networking class and the upcoming JAVA ones are going to be fun</p>
        <p>Study progress has been better in period 2. I have made every assigment on week and on time. Project 1 has been passed with 8.0.
            Information management passed.</p>
        <p>I will definitely continue with my studies here in NHL Stenden. I still believe this was the choice to make after everything</p>
